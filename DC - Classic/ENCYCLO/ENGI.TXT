THE SENTINEL CAN "WALK" ITSELF ACROSS BATTLEFIELDS AND BURY ITSELF BELOW THE GROUND, WHERE IT IS HIDDEN FROM ENEMY VIEW.

WHEN DEPLOYED, THE UNIT BURROWS INTO THE GROUND USING AN ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC COUNTER-WEIGHT HAMMER.

ANY ENEMY UNIT COMING WITHIN 1m OF THE SENTINEL WILL CAUSE IT TO DETONATE, LAUNCHING EXPLOSIVE SHRAPNEL AT THE ENEMY.

THE SENTINEL HAS THREE EXPLOSIVE CHARGES.  THE LAST CHARGE COMPLETELY DESTROYS THE SENTINEL.
