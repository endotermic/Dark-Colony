MADE STRICTLY FOR DEFENSIVE PURPOSES, THE FIRESTORM SERIES MOBILE TURRET CAN LAUNCH FIRESTORM VII MISSILES AT LAND AND AIR TARGETS. THIS MAKES IT A VERY VALUABLE ASSET IN ALL BATTLE SITUATIONS.

ALTHOUGH THE CARBONIC STEEL ARMOR IS VERY STRONG, THE UNIT'S DELICATE COMPONENTS ARE LEFT EXPOSED WHEN MOBILE.

ONCE THE FIRESTORM IS DEPLOYED IT IS LOCKED IN PLACE WITH EXPLOSIVE BOLTS AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE UNDEPLOYED.
