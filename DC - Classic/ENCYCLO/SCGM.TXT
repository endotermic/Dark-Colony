THE VTOL'S MAIN USE IS FOR RECONNAISSANCE. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE AGAINST HEAVY GROUND BASED WEAPONS.

BECAUSE OF IT'S CARBON FIBER BODY IT IS VERY MANEUVERABLE, WHICH MAKES IT HARDER FOR LARGER UNITS TO TARGET IT.

IT'S CARBON FIBER ALSO HAS ONE DRAWBACK WHICH IS THAT IT MAKES FOR VERY WEAK ARMOR. WITH A FEW WELL PLACED SHOTS IT IS EASILY RENDERED INOPERATIVE.
