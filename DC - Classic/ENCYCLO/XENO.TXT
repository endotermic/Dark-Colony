THE XENOWORT WAS BRED AS A PURELY DEFENSIVE UNIT.

WHEN IN IT'S MOBILE FORM IT IS VERY EASILY KILLED BECAUSE OF IT'S FRAGILE STRUCTURE. ONCE DEPLOYED, HOWEVER, ONLY IT'S EXTREMELY DENSE POSTERIOR IS EXPOSED.

GENETICALLY ALTERED TO HAVE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF BONE, SKIN AND CARTILAGE, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DESTROY.

AFTER THE XENOWORT HAS BURIED ITSELF IT LACKS THE ABILITY TO REMOVE ITSELF FROM THE GROUND.
