THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE EXPLOITER IS TO CONVERT RAW PETRA-7 INTO AN ENERGY WAVEFORM.

THE BASIC UNIT CAN BE RETRO-FITTED TO HANDLE A VARIETY OF TASKS, SUCH AS THE EXCAVATION OF "ARTIFACTS".

ITS CARBON FIBER COMPOSITE ARMOR MAKES IT VERY FAST, YET WEAK AGAINST SMALL ATTACKS. ITS LACK OF DEFENSIVE WEAPONS MAKES IT AN EASY TARGET WHEN LEFT UNGUARDED.

WHEN DEPLOYED OVER A PETRA VENT THE EXPLOITER'S ARMOR LOCKS INTO A MORE STABLE POSITION MAKING IT MUCH HARDER TO DAMAGE.
