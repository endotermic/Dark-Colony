THE ORTU IS A MULTI-PURPOSE BOMBER/RECON CREATURE. IT STRIKES FAST AND HARD RAINING DEATH ON THE LUCKLESS UNITS BELOW.

BECAUSE OF IT'S THIN HOLLOW BONE STRUCTURE IT IS VERY MANEUVERABLE AND THUS HARDER FOR LARGER UNITS TO TARGET.

IT'S FRAGILE COMPOSITION MAKES IT VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE. WITH A FEW WELL PLACED SHOTS IT CAN BE EASILY KILLED.
