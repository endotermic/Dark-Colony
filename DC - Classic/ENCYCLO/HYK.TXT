THIS SPHERICAL UNIT IS BELIEVED TO BE AN ANCIENT SLAUGHTERING DEVICE.

WHEN ACTIVATED, THE KAOX DROPS TO .2m ABOVE THE GROUND AND OPENS UP TO REVEAL TWENTY-FIVE SPINNING CARBONIC BLADES THAT SHRED EVERTHING IN IT'S PATH.

THE KAOX'S MAIN DRAWBACK IS THAT IT MOVES IN A RANDOM PATTERN, AND ONCE ACTIVATED KILLS ANYTHING, EVEN FRIENDLY UNITS.

CLASSIFICATION PENDING.
