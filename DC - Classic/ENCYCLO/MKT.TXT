IN IT'S DORMANT STATE, THE MAKTOR HOVERS 4.2 METERS FROM THE GROUND. WHEN THE MAKTOR IS ACTIVATED, ITS FIVE PETALS UNFOLD AND IT BURIES ITSELF ABOUT 0.3M METRES INTO THE GROUND. WHEN ANY TROOPS ENTER ITS RADIUS, THE MAKTOR SUCKS ALL THE TRESPASSING UNITS INTO ITS GRAVITY WELL, FUSING THEIR ATOMIC MASS WITH ITS OWN GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY.

IT IS BELIEVED TO BE AN ANCIENT WASTE DISPOSAL DEVICE.
