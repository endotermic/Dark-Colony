~1...MIND LINK ESTABLISHED...

~4Our ~2MIND SCANS ~4have revealed that ~2MARS ~4has unwanted visitors...the ~2HUMANS. ~4The ~2HIGH COUNCIL ~4has determined that these ~2HUMANS ~4are divided into three seperate tribes. The strongest and most efficient of these three tribes is a red uniformed tribe that calls itself ~2PAN LUMA INDUSTRIES. ~4The other two lesser tribes call themselves ~2AEROGEN and ~2STRATUS.  

~4We do not know what these strange names mean, nor do we care, brother. The only thing we are concerned with is the extermination of any and all of these pitiful ~2HUMANS ~4that have infested our new home.

~4It is understood that the tribe ~2AEROGEN, ~4has begun an attempt to manipulate the atmosphere of our ~2MARS ~4to accommodate their inferior respiratory systems.

You will stop them from upsetting the rich toxins this planet generates, brother.

The ~2ROSWELL TAAR'S ~4abductions on ~2EARTH ~4have taught us many things about these ~2HUMANS, ~4brother. For example, we know that their night-time optical sensors are far inferior to ours,  therefore, attacks at night are favorable.

You must put an end to the ~2HUMANS' ~4meddling. Damage to our planet's ecosystem will not be tolerated.
