~1...MIND LINK ESTABLISHED...

~2STRATUS ~4has asked for our assistance to help protect their main base of operation, ~2STRATUS SPHERE-3, ~4against the two other ~2HUMAN ~4tribes, but now that we have gained what we need from ~2STRATUS, ~4we do not need them any longer.

~4Offer them only enough assistance to keep the ~2HUMANS ~4battling amongst themselves, while you gather your forces.

The ~2COUNCIL ~4feels that only the ~2TAAR ~4should be left standing after this battle.
