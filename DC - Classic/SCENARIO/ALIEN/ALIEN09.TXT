~1...MIND LINK ESTABLISHED...

~4Brother, the ~2COUNCIL ~4has determined that the underground labyrinth that you have discovered holds more secrets of the ~2ANCIENT ARTIFACTS.
 
~4Your mission is to explore this labyrinth and to find the ~2CHAMBER OF ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE.

~4We have already sent two teams into the labyrinth, but all attempts to contact them have failed... 

Your team will be teleported to three separate entry points in the underground, and will consist of ~2WARRIORS, SY DEMONS, ~4and ~2GORREM. ~4The ~2GORREM ~4are our latest genetic effort, equipped with a weapon we simply call ~2DISEASE. ~4This weapon can be used to both ensnare, and damage your enemies.

The ~2COUNCIL ~4agrees that the ~2GORREMS ~4will be necessary for you to complete your mission, as is the use of ~2STEALTH ~4by your ~2WARRIORS.

~4Do not dishonor the ~2TARR, ~4brother.
