~1...MIND LINK ESTABLISHED...

~4Be proud, ~4brother, for we have extracted the knowledge from the tiny brain of ~2CMDR.TICK ~4and are now able to control his actions.

~4From his ~2BRAIN SCRUBBING, ~4we have discovered that ~2STRATUS' ~4ally, ~2PAN LUMA, ~4has already begun an ~2ARTIFACT ~4excavation near the ~2CITADEL, ~4their main base of operations.

We have sent our puppet ~2CMDR.TICK ~4to deceive the ~2PAN LUMA ~4troops that are guarding the excavation site. ~2TICK ~4will lead them away to another ~2ARTIFACT ~4site allowing you to take what is rightfully ours...The ~2ARTIFACT ~4known as ~2LUNATEK.

~4Deploying a ~2LUNATEK ~4over the pitiful ~2HUMANS ~4will turn the ~2HAIRLESS APES ~4against one another. 

Use it wisely and be proud.
