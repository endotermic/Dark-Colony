~1...MIND LINK ESTABLISHED...

~4The pitiful ~2HUMANS ~4have been herded back to their last remaining territory, they so ironically named ~2DESTINY ONE.

~4It is here that you will crush the ~2HUMANS, ~4for the ~2ARTIFACT ~4that you have found is ~2PORTALIS.

~4Once deployed, the ~2PORTALIS ~4will destroy anything and everything in its path.

~4It will be given to you to help battle the ~2HUMAN ~4forces after we have performed our ~2MIND PROBES ~4on it. This will ensure that you will be able to control it completely, for it is a very powerful ~2ARTIFACT ~4and must be brought under our control.

Be proud, brother, for today begins a new era for the ~2TAAR.
