~1...MIND LINK ESTABLISHED...

~4You have failed us and disgraced yourself by letting the ~2STRATUS ~4leader, ~2COMMANDER TICK ~4escape. You must, once again, prove that you are worthy of being ~2TAAR.

~4We have tracked ~2TICK ~4to his home planet of ~2EARTH ~4and it is your honor to attempt his abduction once again.

There is another ~2TRIBE ~4of ~2TAAR ~4already on ~2EARTH. ~4They have been there for quite some time and they call themselves ~2ROSWELL TAAR.

~4We have made contact with them, but they will not help us without some sort of payment. It seems that they have already been among the ~2HUMANS ~4for far too long, and they have embraced several of the humans ideologies such as ~2GREED.

~4You must find all the ~2PETRA-7 ~4tanks that ~2STRATUS ~4has on ~2EARTH. ~4We will  transfer the energy to the ~2ROSWELL TAAR, ~4and then they will assist you.

~2HUMAN ~4slaughter is a proud and honorable thing.

Be proud, and restore your honor, brother.
