~2THE BROWNBILL SWAMPS ~4is where we need your immediate help, ~2COMMANDER. ~4Our ~2BASE, ~4as well as ~2AEROGEN'S, ~4have been the victims of numerous violent ~2ALIEN ~4attacks.

~2AEROGEN'S BASES ~4have been completely decimated.

We are sending you in on a salvage mission to locate any ~2AEROGEN ~4units that may still be on the battlefield. This may buy you enough time to bring our ~2BASE ~4back online and to reclaim this territory.

This, to date, will probably be your most difficult mission, ~2COMMANDER.

~4Succeed where ~2AERGOEN ~4has failed.
