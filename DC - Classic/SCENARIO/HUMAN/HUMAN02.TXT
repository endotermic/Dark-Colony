~4Since you are obviously a born leader, we will be needing your skills protecting a base from ~2ALIEN ~4attacks.

We need you to begin our mining efforts in the ~2SEN FIELDS, ~4located in the vast deserts of ~2MARS. ~4Once there, you should concentrate on mining ~2PETRA-7 ~4and protecting our new ~2COMMUNICATION SATELLITES.

~4Don't forget, ~2COMMANDER, PETRA-7 ~4vents aren't always active. Newly erupting vents can be identified by a distinctive runmbling sound.

The ~2ALIENS ~4have already killed one of our ~2COMMANDERS ~4that we had stationed there, so we advise extreme caution in dealing with the situation.

After a few days a new ~2COMMANDER ~4will be arriving to relieve you, so let's make his visit an enjoyable one.

Good Luck.
