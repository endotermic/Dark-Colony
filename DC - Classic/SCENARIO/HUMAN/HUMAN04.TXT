~1...DOWNLOADING TRANSMISSION...

~4We have received a transmission from ~2STRATUS CORPORATION, ~4asking us to locate one of their ~2COMMANDERS ~4that has disappeared somewhere in the ~2ALLUSION ISLANDS.

~4We have a mining operation in the area, so we have agreed to assist them. You should be aware that the ~2ALIENS ~4have dug themselves in at strategic locations throughout the ~2ISLANDS. ~4The little buggers are tricky, so be careful.
