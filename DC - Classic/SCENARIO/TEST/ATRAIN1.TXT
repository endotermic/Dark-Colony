~4Greetings brother, the High Council has chosen you for basic training.

Be Proud.

The wasteful humans have unknowingly given us the perfect location to educate those, such as yourself, in the ways of war.

You will begin your education here on EARTH, at a long forgotten military facility the humans call AREA 51.

We will be conducting your training at night to avoid the remote chance of human intervention.

There is much you must learn brother, before you join the battle on MARS.

Do Well.

~7We will begin your education with basic Petra-7 mining techniques.
