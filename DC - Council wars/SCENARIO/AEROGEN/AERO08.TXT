~4This is it, ~2COMMANDER. ~4We have finally reached our goal; the ~2VALLEY OF THE HIGH COUNCIL.

~4Intelligence believes that these ~2ALIENS ~4have a weapon of ultimate destruction, but they are unable to verify what it is, or how it is used.

We do know, however, that the southern-most ~2HIVE ~4that blocks our path to the ~2ALIEN HIGH COUNCIL PALACE ~4holds this ~2ARTIFACT ~4of mass destruction.

Destroy the ~2HIVE, ~4and the ~2ARTIFACT ~4will be yours.

Our advice to you is to concentrate your efforts on destroying this ~2ALIEN HIVE ~4first, ~4while defending against the others.

Be careful, for this is your finest hour, and most dangerous mission.
