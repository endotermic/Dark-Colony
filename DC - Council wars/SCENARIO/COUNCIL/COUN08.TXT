~4The ~2HIGH COUNCIL ~4has been watching you, ~2BROTHER, ~4and are very pleased with your efforts in the war against the ~2HUMANS.

~4We have agreed to make you a ~2HIGH COUNCIL ~4member if you are able to defeat the ~2HUMANS ~4once and for all.

~4The ~2HUMANS ~4have also discovered a new ~2ARTIFACT ~4at a ruin site to the ~2SOUTH ~4of your ~2HIVE. ~4Destroy their excavation site, and this ~2ARTIFACT ~4will be yours.

~4the ~2COUNCIL ~4believes that obtaining this new ~2ARTIFACT ~4is critical in your effort to destroy the ~2HUMANS, ~4as is the amount of time in which you take to complete your mission.

We believe that it will take the ~2HUMANS ~4two day cycles to harness the power of the new ~2ARTIFACT.

~4As soon as this is done, they will most likely bring this power into battle with them, and destroy you.

Make us proud.
