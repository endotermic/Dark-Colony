~1...DOWNLOADING TRANSMISSION...

~4Our intelligence has discovered what may very well be another entrance to ~2THE UNDERGROUND. ~4It is believed to be heavily guarded by an ~2ALIEN STRONGHOLD.

~4Your mission is to destroy the ~2ALIEN HIVE ~4and to investigate the area where we believe the ~2SITE ~4is.

Now for the bad news ~2COMMANDER, ~4your ~2BASE'S EXO-CENTER ~4is currently off-line, and is unable to produce ~2EXPLOITERS. ~4We will be outfitting you with a few experimental ~2S.A.R.G.E.S ~4which you will need to use to steal resources for you.

Deploying a ~2S.A.R.G.E. ~4near an enemy mining unit will intercept 50% of their resources and transfer them to your ~2BASE. 

~4The ~2S.A.R.G.E. ~4has a long stealing range, and does not need to be in visual sight of the target to steal, so use your ~2OSPREY IVS ~4to spot the mining site while your ~2S.A.R.G.E. ~4is deployed from a safe distance.

We will try to provide you with ~2EXPLOITERS ~4as we can.

Once you have enough resources, build up a strong attack force to carry out your objectives.
