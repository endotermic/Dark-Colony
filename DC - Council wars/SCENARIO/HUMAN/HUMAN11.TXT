~1...DOWNLOADING TRANSMISSION...

~4Great work, ~2COMMANDER. ~4Not only did you overcome great odds in defeating the ~2ALIENS, ~4but you also found another entrance to ~2THE UNDERGROUND. ~4Intelligence believes that it is also the location where the ~2ALIENS ~4are holding some of our ~2P.O.W.s.

~4Find the area they are holding our ~2P.O.W.s, ~4and try to rescue as many as you can. Any of our ~2SOLDIERS ~4that are already under ~2ALIEN ~4control should be exterminated with extreme prejudice.

It doesn't get any easier ~2COMMANDER.

~4You must also locate and secure any ~2ARTIFACT CHAMBERS ~4you find.

Good luck ~2COMMANDER.
