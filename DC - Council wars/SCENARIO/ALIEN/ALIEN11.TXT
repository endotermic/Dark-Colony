~1...MIND LINK ESTABLISHED...

~4We have received a distress call from one of our ~2HIVES ~4in ~2SPIDER CANYON, ~4brother. It appears the filthy ~2HUMANS ~4have completely infested the area.

They have almost destroyed our ~2HIVE, ~4and we are unable to breed any more ~2BROZAARS.

~4The only survivors that remain in the area are the ~2GORREMS ~4that have hidden themselves among the ~2SPIDER PLANTS.

~4Deploying a ~2GORREM ~4near an enemy mining unit will intercept 50% of their resources and transfer them to your ~2HIVE. 

~4The ~2GORREM ~4has a long stealing range, and does not need to be in visual sight of the target to steal, so use your ~2ORTUS ~4to spot the mining site while your ~2GORREM ~4is deployed from a safe distance.

Your mission is to find these ~2GORREM ~4and use their abilities to bring the ~2HIVE ~4back to life.

Once you have built up a sizable army, you may crush the ~2HUMANS ~4and destroy their ~2BASE.

~4Do not fail us, brother.
