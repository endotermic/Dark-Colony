~4The ~2COUNCIL ~4has chosen you for a very important mission, brother.

The blue devils, known as ~2STRATUS, ~4have laid waste to our southern-most settlement. This nefarious band is led by one called ~2COMMANDER TICK, ~4we believe that he has discovered an area that contains ~2ANCIENT ARTIFACTS ~4of great power. You must take control of this area at all costs and perform an abduction of this ~2COMMANDER TICK, ~4so we may extract any knowledge he has of these ~2ANCIENT ARTIFACTS. 

~4You will be dropped off behind the enemy's front-line. You must locate their ~2PETRA-7 ~4storage depot. Once located, you will steal their ~2PETRA-7 ~4energy and use it to fuel
your assault on the ~2STRATUS ~4tribe.
 
It will be your honor to restore our southern-most front and remove the ~2HUMANS
~4from the area. 

Do not fail us, brother.
