~3COURSE DESCRIPTION:
~7This course will teach you defensive skills using LAND MINE Units.

~1HERE ARE YOUR ORDERS...

~4Build a ~2SCIENCE-POD. ~4This will allow you to create land mines, which we call ~2SENTINELS, ~4that you will be able to ~2DEPLOY ~4into the ground.

You will move them to the ~2EXPLOITER ~4North-West of your base and you will ~2DEPLOY ~4the ~2SENTINELS ~4around the ~2EXPLOITER ~4in order to protect it from approaching enemies.

Each ~2SENTINEL ~4has three charges, and there is a 6 second delay before each charge activates, so you might want to double up the in the placing of your ~2SENTINELS.

~4If any of the drones reach the ~2EXPLOITER, ~4your mission will be a failure.

~2REMEMBER: ~4Pressing the ~2ENTER ~4key will ~2DEPLOY ~4your ~2SENTINELS.
