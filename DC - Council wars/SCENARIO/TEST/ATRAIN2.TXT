~4Good work brother. The COUNCIL is impressed.

~7You will continue your education by learning the fundamentals of unit movement.

~1HERE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS...

~4You will need to build a ~2WARRIOR FOLD ~4and train ~23 ~4infantry units.

~4Follow the arrows to ~2MARKER 1, ~4but ~2DO NOT ENGAGE THE ENEMY! ~4To do so will mean defeat.

Instead, set your ~2GRAYS ~4to ~2MOVE 'M' ~4mode. This way your ~2GRAYS ~4will avoid firing at the practice drones.

Once you have reached the marker, await further orders.

~2REMEMBER: ~4If you stop along the way, your ~2GRAYS ~4will engage the attack drones.
