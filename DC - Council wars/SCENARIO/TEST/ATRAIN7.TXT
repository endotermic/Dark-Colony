~4Excellent work brother. This will be your final lesson of advanced training. After you have completed this lesson, you will have proven to the COUNCIL that you have the makings of a great leader, and are worthy of being XIMAL.

~4Be Proud.

~7You will now be educated in the ways of ZISPS (Healers).

~1HERE ARE YOUR ORDERS...

~4Build a ~2NEURAL HIVE ~4and breed ~24 ZISPS ~4(Healers). These units are used to heal troops that have been injured in battle.

Once your ~2ZISPS ~4have been bred, follow the arrows to your injured ~2WARRIORS, ~4heal them, and continue following the next set of arrows to the ~2PETRA-7 ~4vent.

If any of your ~2WARRIORS ~4are killed, your mission will be a failure.
