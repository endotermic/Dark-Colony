STRATEGY TIPS:

- units in Dark Colony depend on each other for optimum battle performance.
ie. units like artillery may need troops to provide protection from airborne 
threats, and artillery can increase its range greatly if it you use airborne 
scouts as "spotters". 

- Much of the skill in mastering Dark Colony, is the optimal use of a variety 
of unit types in the tactical battles.  

-remember Alien forces are more effective fighters at night (vision/targeting 
skill etc.) and Humans are more effective in daytime hours.

-keep an eye out for newly erupting resources. In addition, some plant types
seem to thrive in the presence of petra-7 gas.

-try to defend important areas with a variety of units
