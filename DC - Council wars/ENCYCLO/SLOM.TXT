THE SLOM HAS BEEN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO BE A SUICIDAL DEFENCE BEAST.

IT'S THIN OUTER SKIN BARELY PROTECTS THE HIGHLY VOLATILE HYDROGEN MIXTURE CONTAINED WITHIN IT'S BODY.

THE SLOM WILL BURY ITSELF IN THE GROUND AND LIE IN WAIT UNTIL AN UNSUSPECTING UNIT PASSES OVER AND TRIGGERS IT'S DEVASTATING BLAST.

THE SLOM IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING THREE DETONATIONS BEFORE IT IS DESTROYED.
