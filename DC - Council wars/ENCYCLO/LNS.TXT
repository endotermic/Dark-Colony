IN IT'S DORMANT STATE, THE SOLARIS HOVERS 4.2 METERS FROM THE GROUND. WHEN THE SOLARIS IS ACTIVATED, IT BEGINS TO ABSORB ALL LIGHT WITHIN A 40 KM RADIUS AND THEN FOCUSES IT INTO A 2 METER WIDE BOLT OF ENERGY DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.

INITIAL EXPERIMENTATION RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 180 SCIENTISTS.

IT IS BELIEVED TO BE AN ANCIENT DEMOLITION DEVICE.
