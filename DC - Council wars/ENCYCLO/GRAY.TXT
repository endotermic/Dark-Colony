~4AS THE MAIN UNIT OF THE TAAR ARMY, THE WARRIOR IS A WELL ROUNDED UNIT. INEXPENSIVE TO TRAIN AND ABLE TO ATTACK BOTH GROUND AND AIR UNITS, THE WARRIOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT UNIT BY FAR.

A SMALL BODY SIZE AND RELATIVELY WEAK ARMOR REQUIRES THAT THEY ATTACK IN LARGE NUMBERS TO DO ANY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.
