THE REAPER CLASS MECH WAS BUILT WITH ONE THING IN MIND, RAW FIRE POWER. ITS 10mm AUTO CANNON MAKES IT AN EXCELLENT GROUND ATTACK WEAPON.

A SMALL GROUP MIXED WITH SOME INFANTRY CAN VERY EASILY TAKE OUT A BUILDING OF ANY SIZE. ITS ONLY DRAWBACK IS ITS SHORT RANGE, BUT THIS IS OVERCOME QUITE NICELY BY THE FACT THAT IT HAS A VERY TOUGH COATING OF KEVLAR OVER ITS TITANIUM ARMOR.
