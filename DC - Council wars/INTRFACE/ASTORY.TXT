~2OVERVIEW:

~4The horrific fighting on Mars was beginning to take it's toll as  large sections of freshly terra-formed land began regressing back to it's original, barren condition.  While Pan Luma Industries led the human fight on the main front, Aerogen Corporation setup their main operations on the dark side of the planet where these problems were  most severe.

It was a typical Martian night when a small group of engineers on a routine maintenance  task stumbled across an alien base. This discovery would later reveal itself to be the headquarters of the Taar leaders, known as the High Council. As the engineer's lives ended in a quick, bloody slash, the battle for Mars had now developed a second front.  

~0The Council Wars had begun.
